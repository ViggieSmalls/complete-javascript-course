## Numbers, Dates, Intl and Timers

### Working with BigInt

* regular numbers are represented with 64 bits.
  The highest possible number that can be represented correctly in JS is `2**53 -1`, because the other bits are used for storing the sign and the decimal places, plus counting starts at 0.
* BigInt can be written as `123n` or `BigInt(123)`, though latter is susceptible for errors when converting from a regular number.
* Operations between BigInt and regular numbers are restricted.
* `Math` operations are not possible.
